# Feature Reduction in Time Series CNC Machine Data

This repository contains the code and implementation for a collaborative academic project developed as part of the **Autonomous Multisensor Systems Lab** at **Otto von Guericke University (OVGU)** in 2025.

The goal of the project was to reduce the dimensionality of high-frequency time-series data collected from CNC machines. We explored three approaches for feature reduction â€” **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, a **Dense Autoencoder**, and a **sequence-aware LSTM+CNN Autoencoder** â€” and evaluated how well the reduced features could be used to predict electrical current for the spindle and X/Y/Z axes.

The focus was on reducing model complexity and sensor input size while preserving predictive accuracy and interpretability, with deployment constraints in mind (e.g., edge computing, limited latency).

### ðŸ“‚ Notes

- A **smaller trial version of the dataset** is included in this repository to demonstrate the pipeline.  
  The full dataset used in the original project is not shared due to size and restrictions.
- For experimental results, evaluation metrics, and analysis, refer to the final report.
